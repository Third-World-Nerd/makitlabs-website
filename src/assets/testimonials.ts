      "I am truly grateful to Makit Labs for creating such an opportunity in Nepal. Since joining, I have seen a remarkable change in Manjil, he has become more curious, creative, and eager to work on projects instead of spending time on games or YouTube. Even though he is younger than the usual admission age, Makit Labs has gone the extra mile to customize the content for him, making it easy to understand and apply. I especially value how the program focuses not just on programming but on overall engineering, and the monthly progress reports help me stay updated despite being far from home. Overall, my experience has been excellent, and I would happily rate it a solid 5 out of 5.",
